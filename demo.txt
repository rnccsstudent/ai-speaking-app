Hey! I just made a cool app!

It takes English text,speaks it aloud in different accents like(uk,us,indian) and then shows the bengali translation after the voice finishes!

It even plays a fun talking video while speaking! After that, another video plays and shows the translated text. 

It's useful if you want to improve pronunciation and understand the meaning in Bengali. Wanna try it?
